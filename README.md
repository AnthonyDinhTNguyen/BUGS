# BUGS
Coding Competition to teach programming. Contestants create a program to control an ant colony and compete against other colonies to see who's logic helps their colony succeed the most. To run the program, specify in the command line the example arena (included example field.txt), and 4 .bug files (two examples included).
Implements a Coding Competition to teach new people the basics of programming in a fun hands on way. Contestants create programs using an interpretted
language we designed to control their respective ant colonies. The colonies compete over resourses, and we see who's programming logic
helps their colony thrive the most.
To run this program, specify on the command line a field (the arena the colonies compete in) and 4 .bug files to control 4 respective
colonies.
I've included an example field called field.txt and 2 example .bug programs, called Trial.bug and USCant.bug to test with.
